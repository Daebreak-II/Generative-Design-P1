Survival Story - a simple sotry that changes a bit each time you run it

Artist Statement:

I was just trying to go for sort of a mad-libs feel with this version as that's what this project sort of reminded me of
in the first place. So the tone is meant to be more on the silly side, same as the template but a bit morsoe.
The new level of complexity is when in the story two objects are combined to create a new one.
